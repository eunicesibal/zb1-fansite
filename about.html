        <div class="about_me_p">
            <p>I'm a software development student who is currently in a ZB1 brainrot. Seeing that the debut mini-album
                has compsci elements I decided to use my coding passion and new-found ZB1 love and make a website to celebrate their debutation.

                This website isn't anything serious and just simple fun for me! Also an opportunity
                for me to practice my front-end skills. Apologies for the outlook of the site.
                Graphic design is clearly my passion. This is a website that will continue to grow. Later in the future I aim to add more content, features that is hopefully
                cool and fun. Feel free to browse and play around the site.
            </p>

                For possible legal reasons: this is purely fan-content for ZEROBASEONE only. I don't make any money from this website nor do i own any images, features or iconography.
